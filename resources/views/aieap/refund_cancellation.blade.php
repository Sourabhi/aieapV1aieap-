       <li> If immigration authorities at a Canadian Embassy or High Commission Office issue a letter denying the request for a study permit, and the AIEAP Office receives a copy of the letter of denial accompanied by formal notification of withdrawal or request for deferral within 10 business days of the beginning of a school year, then the total fees less $200.00 will be refunded or deferred. Fees paid in advance for future school year(s) will be refunded or deferred in full.</li><br>

       <li>  If notice of cancellation is received less than 28 days before the commencement date of your course, 60 % tuition will be refunded.</li><br>

       <li>  No refund is payable after you have commenced studying at AIEAP.</li><br>
